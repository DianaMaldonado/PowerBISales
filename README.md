Hello!

This is a sales dashboard elaborated with Power BI. The aim of this dashboard is to quickly identify sales trends by total and by categories (location and products) and also identify order patterns to design and implement data-driven marketing strategies.
The guide questions are:
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month? 
2. What City had the highest number of sales? 
3. What time and day of the week should we display adverstisement to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product? 
4. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most? 

The dataset used in this case is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/knightbearr/sales-product-data. 12 csv files were imported into Power BI, cleaned, and merged into a single dataset.
To work with visualizations a Dates table was created, as well as DAX measures to work with time intelligence saving space in queries.
